# Classify-Song-Genres-from-Audio-Data
Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), I trained a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify). I used pandas and seaborn packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors when doing machine learning.

Next, I used the scikit-learn package to predict whether I can correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. I implemented common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression, decision trees, and so forth.
